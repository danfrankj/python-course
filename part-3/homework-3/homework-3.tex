50 points total.  70+\% correctness (35+ points) is needed to pass.  There is also the opportunity for 5 bonus points.  Remember: you must pass all assignments to pass the class.  The assignment is due at the beginning of the next class.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Textual analysis} \\
An \emph{n-gram} is a sequence of $n$ consecutive words in a text.  For example, the $2$-grams of:
\begin{center}
 ``I love the Python programming language"
\end{center} are ``I love", ``love the", ``the Python", ``Python programming", and ``programming langue";  the $3-$grams are ``I love the", "love the Python", "the Python programming", and "Python programming language"; and so on for larger values of $n$.  We say that there are no $7$-grams for this sentence because there are only $6$ words.

$n$-grams are sometimes used to analyze patterns in text (for example, see Google's Ngram Viewer at \url{http://books.google.com/ngrams}).  In this assignment, you are going to implement a function that computes the $k$ most frequently occurring $n$-grams in a text file. \\

\textbf{Delivarables} \\
Implement \texttt{ngram()} in the file \texttt{ngram.py}.  The function definition is: \\

\begin{lstlisting}
                       def ngram(n, k, document):
\end{lstlisting}
$n$ specifies that we are computing $n$-grams, $k$ specifies that we want the $k$ most frequently occurring $n$-grams (breaking ties arbitrarily), and \emph{document} is the name of a file containing the text.  If there are fewer than $k$ $n$-grams, return all $n$-grams).  The return value should be a dictionary with keys given by $n$-grams and values given by $n$-gram frequency in the text  (if no $n$-grams are found, say for $n$ too big, return an empty dictionary).  \\

Record the output from \texttt{test1()} and \texttt{test2()} \setpoints{20}.  These tests use the files \texttt{course\_description.txt} and \texttt{bill\_of\_rights.txt}. \\

Assume that the file \texttt{document} contains no punctuation.  Also assume that all words are separated by a single space. Note that capital letters constitute different words, so ``Python programming" and``python programming" would be counted as different 2-grams. \\

Finally, only compute $n$-grams that occur on a single line of the text (not $n$-grams that contain words from the end of one line and the beginning of the next line).  Therefore, you can follow the examples from lecture on reading a file line-by-line. \\

%\textbf{Grading} \\
%To grade this question, tests will be conducted by calling the functions you implement.  Each test is worth 0 points (do not pass test) or 1 point (pass test).  There are 25 total tests.

%All of the tests used for grading are distributed with the assignment.  Gaming the autograder by hard-coding the answers of the provided test functions is considered cheating and a violation of the Stanford honor code.  I will be testing your code with additional (unreleased) tests to ensure that there is no cheating.

%To run the autograder, simply do \texttt{python grader.py}.  See the documentation in \texttt{grader.py} for running individual tests.

\item \textbf{Money classes} \\
The file \texttt{stocks.py} contains the skeleton code for a stock portfolio class.  This class is similar in spirit to the one presented in class, but it is a different class with different functionality.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement the \texttt{add\_stock()} and \texttt{most\_money()} functions.  What gets printed from calling the function \texttt{test1()}? \setpoints{8}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumii}{1}
\item Implement the \texttt{\_\_contains\_\_()} function.  Remember from lecture that this is a special function that works with the \texttt{in} operator.  What gets printed from calling the function \texttt{test2()}? \setpoints{7}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item \textbf{NumPy} \\
In this problem, we will explore the basics of NumPy.  Place all of your code into a file called \texttt{myfirstnumpy.py}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install NumPy on your machine.  Record the output of the following lines.  \setpoints{3} \\
\texttt{>>> import numpy as np} \\
\texttt{>>> np.eye(4, 4)} \\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumii}{1}
\item The files \texttt{a.txt} and \texttt{b.txt} each contain data for a vector.  Each row of each file contains one floating point number.  Read the files \texttt{a.txt} and \texttt{b.txt} and store the data into two lists, \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}.  What are the lengths of these lists?  They should be the same.  \setpoints{3}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumii}{2}
\item Use the \texttt{numpy.dot()} function to compute the dot product of these vectors.  See:
\begin{center}
\url{http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html}
\end{center}
\setpoints{3}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumii}{3}
\item Convert your vectors to the \texttt{numpy.array} data type.  Use the normal multiplication operator \texttt{*} to compute the entry-wise multiplication of the vectors into a new vector, \texttt{c}.  Write the elements of \texttt{c} to the file \texttt{c.txt}, one entry per line (the same as the representations in \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}). \setpoints{3}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumii}{4}
\item The one norm of a vector $x$ of length $n$ is given by $||x||_1 = \ssum{i=1}{n}{|x_i|}$, i.e., the sum of the absolute values of the entries. \\

Compute the one norm of the vector $a - b$.  With the \texttt{numpy.array} data type, you can use the normal subtraction operator \texttt{-} to compute $a - b$.  Do not manually compute the norm.  Look up the NumPy norm function and use that. \setpoints{3}.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Python libraries (bonus)} \\
One reason to love Python is the vast amount of libraries that are available.  For this problem, find a Python library related to your major/graduate program/interests and briefly explain what it does.  If you choose NumPy/SciPy, choose a specific application area or function.  Create a sample snippet of code that uses the library.  Place the code in a file called \texttt{bonus.py}  \setbonuspoints {5} 


\item \textbf{Submission} \\
Upload the following files to your Drop Box on Coursework:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{ngram.py}
\item \texttt{stocks.py}
\item \texttt{myfirstnumpy.py}
\item \texttt{c.txt}
\item \texttt{bonus.py} (if applicable)
\end{enumerate}

For the questions that required non-code answers, either type up your solutions and put them in your Drop Box or bring a hard copy to the next lecture.

\end{enumerate}
